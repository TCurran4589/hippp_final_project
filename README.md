Final project writeup

## Project Summary

### Description:

### Project Goals:

## Data
  To accomplish project goals, we used the Chicago Data Portal and downloaded five primary data sets. The .csv files were downloaded from the portal and stored in the folder `data_sources`. The `data_sources` folder contains data for the analysis as well as the cleaned and r estructured data required for the web application. 
  
### Sources:

### Repo Structure

 - the main folder in the repository contains several notebooks used to conduct the analysis:
    - `Merge and plots Female Chlamydia.ipynb`: analysis conducted for reported cases and incidence of chlamydia for females in Chicago community areas.
    - `Merge and plots Female Gonorrhea.ipynb`: analysis conducted for reported cases and incidence of gonorrhea for females in Chicago community areas.
    - `Merge and plots Male Chlamydia.ipynb`: analysis conducted for reported cases and incidence of chlamydia for males in Chicago community areas.
    - `Merge and plots Male Chlamydia.ipynb`: analysis conducted for reported cases and incidence of gonorrhea for males in Chicago community areas.
    -`STI Infection Rates Map.ipynb`: notebook for creating the reported cases map for all STIs in chicago community area
    -`Incidence Map.ipynb`: notebook for creating the incidence map as seen on the dashboard tool
    - `app.py`: contains the web application that is deployed on heroku
    - `reported_cases_map.html`: map produced from `STI infection Rates Map.ipynb`
    - `incidence map.html`: map produced from `Incidence Map.ipynb`
    - `data-sources`: folder with all relevant data needed for web application development and analysis
    - `graphs`: contains the .png versions of the graphs generated during the analysis. It does not contain the interactive plotly maps from the web app.
